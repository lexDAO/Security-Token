# How to use whitelisting

Whitelists are made up of series of addresses.

To create a whitelist, assign a series of addresses with a whitelist number.

    function addToWhitelist(address[] memory addressToAdd, uint8 whitelist) public onlyAdministrator {

To add more addresses to the whitelist, call function with new addresses alongside the specified whitelist name.

With every new whitelist number is a new set of addresses.

# How to control whitelist interactions

    function updateOutboundWhitelistEnabled(uint8 sourceWhitelist, uint8 destinationWhitelist, bool newEnabledValue) public onlyAdministrator {

Call this function to enable/disable the directional interaction of various addresses from certain assigned whitelists.
